    "# Mass Shooting data\n",
    "Questions we seek to investigate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In which state do the highest/lowest number of mass shootings occur? -> Map\n",
    "- Which day of the week has the highest number of shootings occcured? -> Bar\n",
    "- What proportion of the mass shootings were performed by shooters with suspected mental illness? -> Pie\n",
    "- Are there any identifiable trends in motive? \n",
    "- What conclusions can we draw regarding shooters' race/gender? -> correlation?\n",
    "- Did the military experience result in a higher number of victims? -> line\n",
    "- Are there any relationships between attributes of the shooter ie age, gender, race, mental health\n",
    "- How frequently are they occuring?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a relationship between type of weapon used vs number of fatalities?\n",
    "\n",
    "HYPOTHESIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- We hypothesise that a greater number of mass shootings will occur as a result of the shooter suffering from suspected mental illness rather than being motivated by race.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The younger the age of the shooter, the more likely their incident occurred at a school.\n"
