    "A greater number of mass shootings will occur as a result of the shooter suffering from mental illness rather than being motivated by race?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions to explore: \n",
    "1. Are there any relationships with attributes of the shooter - age, gender, mental health, race?\n",
    "2. How frequent are mass shootings occurring in the US - weekly, monthly, annually? \n",
    "3. Where and when are mass shootings occurring most? \n",
    "4. Is there a correlation between location fatalities vs. injured? \n",
    "5. Weapon and shooting type?\n",

    "# Exploration ideas: \n",
    "* Trump is a righty but his fans like to call themselves lefties ---- for LOLs\n",
    "* Comparison between 2016 vs 2006 (10 year comparison) \n",
    "-- Year, Location, Number of Shootings related to race and mental illness \n",
    "* Explore the states/locations of these two years \n",
    "* Did potential technology advancements influence the weapon type involved in the shootings?\n",
    "* Mainstream media/celebrities have influences on the shootings?\n",
    "* Victims involved - types of people involved? \n",
    "* Why did the number of shootings suddenly increase so high? Did most shooters have a mental illness or were they racially motivated? \n",

    "# Presentation: \n",
    "* Executive summary/key findings \n",
    "* How did we decide on this topic? Other topics we were going to explore was housing in Sydney though there was limited data available. \n",
    "* Brainstormed other ideas like mass shootings and explored the datasets available to us\n",
